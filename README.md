# Healthcare Log Ingestion Pipeline (Sample Project)

This is a personal demonstration of a modern data engineering pipeline designed to process simulated healthcare event data using open-source tools.

### ðŸ§° Stack
- **Kafka** for event streaming
- **Databricks** (or Spark) for transformation
- **Snowflake** for warehousing
- **dbt** for modeling
- **Prefect** for orchestration

### ðŸ“¦ What's Included
- Simulated event ingestion config (Kafka)
- Sample transformation logic (Python, dbt)
- Snowflake table schema
- Sample event data (JSON)
- Lightweight Prefect flow for DAG orchestration

> This project is meant to showcase technical skills and architecture familiarity. No client data or proprietary content is included.
